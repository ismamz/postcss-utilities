[postcss-utilities](https://ismamz.github.io/postcss-utilities/) is a [PostCSS] plugin that includes the most commonly used mixins, shortcuts and helpers. It's as easy as specifying `@util utility-name` in your stylesheet, and postcss-utilities will handle the rest for you.

### Motivation

PostCSS has a lot of plugins and some of them use non-standard CSS properties to work as mixins or helpers. This is not a best way for a PostCSS plugin, because developers will not understand what is the source of this property.

> "This plugin saves us from many tiny plugins with unknown properties" _‒[@ai](https://github.com/ai) proposal [postcss/issues/645](https://github.com/postcss/postcss/issues/645)_

### What is the difference between preprocessor’s mixins libraries?

There are lot of Sass Mixins Libraries ([over 65!](http://www.cssauthor.com/sass-mixins-library/)), but postcss-utilities makes the difference. All mixins and helpers are built with JavaScript and you can add to your workflow with ease, as simple as adding [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) or many others useful [PostCSS plugins](https://github.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/plugins.md).

You can forget about copy mixins from project to project and focus on write your project specific mixins and use this plugin for the most generic helpers.

- You don’t need the extra files in your CSS codebase for mixins.
- You don’t need mixins for vendor prefixing (use [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) plugin)
- You can use postcss-utilities with LESS, SASS, vanilla CSS or whatever you choice.

### Quick usage

Using [PostCSS CLI](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-cli) you can do the following:

Install `postcss-cli` and the plugin on your project directory:

```
npm install postcss-cli postcss-utilities --save-dev
```

Add a `postcss` script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
    "postcss": "postcss input.css -u postcss-utilities -o output.css"
}
```

After this, you can run `npm run postcss` and transform your `input.css` into `output.css`.


### Use with [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx)

**styled-jsx** allows you to use full, scoped and component-friendly CSS in your JSX (rendered on the server or the client) and you can add `@util` rules with `postcss-utilities`.

```
npm install --save styled-jsx styled-jsx-plugin-postcss postcss-utilities
```

Add `postcss` config in your `package.json`:

```json
"postcss": {
    "plugins": {
        "postcss-utilities": {}
    }
}
```

Add `styled-jsx/babel` to plugins in your babel configuration:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "styled-jsx/babel"
  ]
}
```

Then write `@util` rules in your code:

```jsx
export default () => (
  <div>
    <p>only this paragraph will get the style :)</p>

    <style jsx>{`
      p {
        color: red;
        @util center;
      }
    `}</style>
  </div>
)
```

### For tasks runners and others enviroments

```js
postcss([ require('postcss-utilities')({ /* options*/ }) ])
```

See [PostCSS] docs for examples of your environment.
